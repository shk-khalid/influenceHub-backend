Exfoliation cleared away dull skin, and the fractional third-generation laser worked its magic to refine my texture and even out my tone.\n\nTo top it off, they used a customized elite mask tailored to my skin\u2019s needs\u2014*mine was an oxygen infusion mask for that extra dewy finish!* My skin feels smooth, radiant, and completely refreshed.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for that red carpet glow, this is IT!

As a student in The Netherlands, fresh from India, I walked in with wide eyes, marveling at the luxury brands on display. I saved up \u20ac23 for my first purchase\u2014a Dior mascara. I saw brands like Dior, Estee Lauder, Lancome, and Benefit, all so beautifully curated. But I also noticed something\u2014none of the models looked like me.\n\nJust 3 years into our journey, here we are. This achievement reflects both our team\u2019s growth and Sephora\u2019s commitment to diversity. Today, we bring our own science-backed version of 5000 years of Indian beauty wisdom to the world. We\u2019re proudly showcasing our rich culture in a modern form.\n\nThe world is ready for India. A homegrown, \u2018made in India\u2019 brand is going to shine on Sephora shelves globally. We get to share rituals like the \u2018champi\u2019 and introduce superherbs like turmeric and ashwagandha, along with household staples like ghee. Just as India introduced Yoga and Meditation to the world, both now scientifically recognized, our beauty traditions are ready for global recognition.\n\nI dream big and never settle for less than the best, but this moment humbles me. None of this would be possible without you. Your support, curiosity, excitement, and loving criticism built this brand brick by brick. From our dining table, while heavily pregnant and during a global pandemic, to NOW.\n\nThis one is for YOU. We started 3 years ago on a Zoom call, and today we are a community of 500,000 strong.

When it was still an improbable proposition. Me? On a Vogue cover? With my daughter? Naaa, that\u2019s ludicrous. \n\nAnd now, here it is. Or actually here they are. The birth of our daughter, the birth of @indewild, the Vogue cover. \n\nTogether we stand - 7 weeks after giving birth - showcasing the raw and unedited version of ourselves. Purely mother and daughter, eager to take on the challenges of the world, one baby step at a time. \n\nAfter two years of blood, sweat, and tears, the power of being different, has come to life. No longer will young women be trapped by societal expectations to cover their insecurities, or feel the need to falsify their persona. Introducing @indewild - a brand like no other. A movement unique to its surroundings. An independent and wild expression of freedom on the day that our \u201cdifference becomes our superpower\u201d.\n\nDedicated to the young girl out there. Consumed by her innocence, mind engrossed with her aspirations to change the world. She is hopeful.\nWho is she? Simple. She is a woman. She is a mother. She is you and I. \u2764\ufe0f\n\u2014\u2014\nHuge thanks to the @vogueindia team for making this the mosttt memorable cover shoot of my life. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude29\n\nPhotographed by Rid Burman (@ridburman)\nStyled by Naheed Driver (@naheedee)\nWords by Aditi Bhimjyani (@aditishahbhimjyani) \nPhoto Assistant: Laura Gavrilenko (@laura_gavry)\nPhotographer's agency: @kaptive_agency\nStyling Assistant: Luca Bouday (@boudayluca)\nHair Stylist: Alexandra Adams (@aspiringalexandra)\nMakeup Artist: Maelys Jallali (@mjs_drawing)\nCreative Producer: Alexandra Carney (@alexandracarney) \nProduction Assistant: Ornella Farines (@ornellafarines)\nVisuals Editor: Jay Modi (@jaymodi2)"", ""viewCount"": 0, ""location"": {""name"": ""Vogue India"", ""address"": """", ""city"": """", ""has_viewer_saved"": false, ""pk"": 236625134, ""short_name"": ""Vogue India"", ""facebook_places_id"": 254608478000126, ""external_source"": ""facebook_places"", ""lng"": 72.84026, ""lat"": 18.934}, ""userTags"": [""diipakhosla"", ""vogueindia"", ""indewild""]}","Male: 24.89%, Female: 75.11%",50211.66667,217,35213.26667,0.021555558,2273.541302,66545065.86,99817598.79,28.44445626

I grew up in an orthodox family. Dad sold fruits & vegetables & Maa was a BMC officer. Childhood was tough; we were struggling. Back then, putting food on the table was a bigger priority than educating your child on topics like mental health & menstruation.\n\nBut at \ud835\udfed\ud835\udfef, I began noticing things\u2013once when we were invited to a Puja, Maa said, \u2018\ud835\udddc \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\u2019\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddfc.\u2019 She wouldn\u2019t set foot inside a temple on \u2018those days\u2019 & neither would she sleep in the same bedroom as Papa. Then when I entered my late teens, that\u2019s when I 1st came to know about it\u2013one day, I noticed Maa visiting the washroom constantly. I asked, \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 She didn\u2019t say anything but Bhai said, \u2018Maa is on her period.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know what that was! Around the same time the girl I was dating told me she was \u2018bleeding\u2019 from inside. That\u2019s how at 20, I started educating myself.\n\nThat led to a lot of questions like \u2019Why aren\u2019t women allowed to enter the temple?\u2019 I even asked Maa. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve been raised that way.\u2019 I then spoke to my sister-in-law, friends, & my girlfriend!\nI wanted to create a change\u2013so last year, I distributed pads to women who had never used them before. Then a few months back, a friend said, \u2018I have such bad mood swings due to my periods.\u2019 I wanted to make her feel happy. So while I ordered food for her, I decided to do something sweet for other girls too\u2026\nI decided to go to marine drive to \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 those women who were on their period. I know I couldn\u2019t reduce their pain but for a few minutes, I could help them forget about it. I wrote messages on a card, gave them flowers, chocolates, & a big hug! A lot of people might find this \u2018cringe.\u2019 But those girls\u2019, \u2018Your sweet gesture made my pain bearable,\u2019 made me feel I had done something right.\n\nPeople need to know this is normal.
